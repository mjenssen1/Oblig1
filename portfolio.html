    <h2>My projects:</h2>
    <h3>Leader of the career day at OsloMet</h3>
    <p>As the leader of the career day at OsloMet in 2019, i was challanged to push my boundaries and take on a leader role. 
       I held a speach infront of the whole school, promoting different companies and encouraging students to get in touch with the compaines. 
       I learned a lot about leadership from this experience, and got great feedback from my team mates on my performance.

    <h3>Painting</h3>
    <p>I painted a picture that took me 3 years to finish. I did this beside my school and work, and it demanded a lot of patience to keep painting. My picture was showcased at the National museum in Oslo for 3 months, and this led to me getting hired at the National museum as a administrative leader.</p>

    <div><h3>Created a new app</h3></div>
    <p>I created an app that helps people to schedule their life. It's called "LiveLaughLove", and is useful to get more structure in every day life, to get more time to do exactly what the name says: live, laugh and love! My app was honored by the prime minister of Norway in 2020, as it was nominated as one of the best apps in norway the same year. </p>
