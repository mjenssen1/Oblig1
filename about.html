        <p>In this <stron>report</strong> we will give a short brief of preperations we did beforehand to ensure the use
                of different
                semantic tags. The reason that we use semantic tags in html are for structuring our page and make it
                more readable. All the tags make it possible to highlight important things on the page,
                such as important content or text.

        </p>

        <ul>
            
            <li>The NAV semantic tag is used to easier navigate between the different sites, and we 
                used the nav-tag in our navigation bar with links to the different sites on our page. 
            </li>

            <li>The footer tag defines the footer for an html document.
                The footer element typically contains for example contact information and
                authorship information, which is what we have included in our footer.
                The footer is easily visible on every page of the website,
                and makes it simple to get an overview of the information.
            </li>
            <li>The body tag is defining the body of the document.
                This is an element that the dokument is required to have to function properly.
                The body element contains amongst other: the headings of the document,
                the paragraphs and all the other elements we used.
                The only elements that is not includede in the body element is the head element, html element and
                doctype element.
            </li>


            <li>The head tag defines the document title, and can hold a handful of different other tags inside of
                itself, like the title tag,
                the style tag and the script tag, defining the title of the document and the style. </li>
            <li>The title tag is used at the top of the HTML document, this one is a required tag.
                The title tag gives the title in the browser toolbar and is also used as the information given in a
                search-engine result. </li>

            <li>The adress tag in HTML is used to write contact information of a person or an organization.</li>
            <li>The article HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or
                site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples
                include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a
                user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>We validated our HTML- og CSS-pages to check that our code is valid.
            Valid code makes our website more user friendly because it reduces the
            risk of error messages when using our website. Validation is useful for
            debugging, quality checks, ease maintenance work and signalises
            professionalism (W3C, u.d.). We’ve used several semantic tags to add information to our web pages.
            Semantic tags such as "nav" ensure easy navigation between the
            various pages in our website. "Title" makes our website more findable,
            which were an important reason for Gretha von Wilhelmsen to design her
            website.
